# Conway's Game of life

The famed conway's game, now on your web browser.

This is a zero players game, the rules are:
- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

For watching it on your own web browser, only go to [*this page*](https://hectorfranc.github.io/game-of-life/), and have fun...
